## Who Should Use Aave Vault?

### Yield-Seeking Token Holders
Individuals who hold ERC-20 tokens supported by Aave v3 can effortlessly grow their holdings by depositing into Aave Vault. The vault abstracts away complex DeFi interactions and automatically channels deposits into Aave's lending pool, delivering yield while protecting simplicity and security.

- **Benefit:** Passive, hands-off earning of yield on supported tokens
- **Scenario:** You hold stablecoins or other assets supported by Aave v3 and want to earn competitive yield without managing positions directly

### dApp Integrators and Developers
Developers building DeFi platforms can include Aave Vault integration to offer their users a seamless yield-generating option.

- **Benefit:** Leverage a standardized, ERC-4626 compliant vault for composable yield strategies
- **Scenario:** You want to embed a yield-earning vault that handles all deposits, withdrawals, and incentives behind the scenes

### Vault Managers and Protocol Owners
These users administer vault parameters and control key operations such as setting fees and claiming rewards. They ensure the vault remains sustainable and profitable.

- **Benefit:** Manage fee-on-yield settings, claim accrued fees and rewards, and perform emergency rescues
- **Scenario:** You oversee vault deployment and want granular operational controls for governance and revenue capture

### Protocol Strategists and Integrators
Protocol teams seeking to incorporate the vault into broader financial products or ecosystems can benefit from the vault’s flexibility and standard interface.

- **Benefit:** A dependable component for building complex DeFi structures or liquidity strategies
- **Scenario:** You are designing protocols that require tokenized vaults with transparent fee and yield mechanics

## Key Use Cases Unlocked by Aave Vault

### 1. Passive Yield Earning on Supported ERC-20 Assets
Deposit your tokens once, and the vault automatically supplies your assets into Aave v3’s lending pool. It handles all conversions and yield accrual, delivering updated value reflected transparently via vault shares.

- Deposit underlying tokens or their corresponding aTokens
- Continuously earn yield based on Aave’s lending pool performance
- Withdraw principal and yield in ERC-20 tokens whenever you wish

### 2. Vault Administration and Fee Management
Vault managers can tune the yield fee ratio, enabling sustainable revenue streams without burdening users.

- Set or adjust fees applied only on earned yield, preserving users’ principal
- Withdraw accrued fees in the form of Aave aTokens
- Claim additional rewards distributed by the Aave incentives controller

### 3. Protocol and dApp Integration
By adhering to the ERC-4626 standard, Aave Vault can be embedded into larger DeFi protocols with minimal friction.

- Simulate deposits, withdrawals, mints, and redeems with up-to-date Aave pool limits
- Use meta-transactions with EIP-712 signatures for enhanced UX and gasless approvals
- Ensure vault state reflects real-time vault balances and fee accruals

### 4. Emergency Token Rescue and Operational Safety
Vault owners can perform emergency rescues of non-AToken assets sent mistakenly to the contract, without interfering with vault assets.

- Protect user funds by designating rescue rights exclusively to the owner
- Prevent accidental rescue of vault’s core aToken assets

## When Is Aave Vault Most Valuable?

- You want a truly passive, secure yield strategy on top of Aave’s market-leading lending pool
- You need an audited, battle-tested vault contract that implements the ERC-4626 standard perfectly
- Your use case demands dynamic fee-on-yield structures that incentivize both users and managers fairly
- You seek composability in DeFi protocols through industry-standard vault interfaces

## Practical Examples

Imagine Alice holds USDC tokens and wants to earn yield without managing loans or collateral herself. She deposits her USDC into Aave Vault, which supplies it into Aave v3 automatically. Over time, her vault shares grow in value as yield accrues, less a small fee on the earned yield that rewards the vault manager.

Meanwhile, Bob, a dApp developer, integrates Aave Vault into his lending platform so his users can easily lock tokens that accrue yield without interacting directly with Aave v3, simplifying the user experience.

Carol, a vault manager, monitors accrued fees and claims them periodically to fund ongoing protocol maintenance and development.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Ensure you only deposit supported ERC-20 assets listed on Aave v3 to avoid failed transactions.
- Vault managers should set fee rates judiciously to balance competitiveness and protocol sustainability.
- Use the meta-transaction features when building UX to reduce gas friction for end users.
- Regularly claim Aave rewards from the vault to maximize overall returns.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- **Deposit Rejections:** Deposits may fail if asset supply caps are reached on Aave. Check `maxDeposit()` to understand limits.
- **Withdrawal Limitations:** Withdrawals depend on Aave’s available liquidity. Use `maxWithdraw()` to verify safe withdrawal amounts.
- **Fee Withdrawal Restrictions:** Only the vault owner can withdraw fees; make sure calls are authorized.
- **Emergency Rescue:** Allowed only for non-core tokens ensuring vault integrity.
