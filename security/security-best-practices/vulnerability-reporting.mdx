# Vulnerability Disclosure Process

Ensuring the security of the Aave Vault ecosystem is a shared responsibility. This page guides security researchers and users who identify vulnerabilities on how to report them responsibly, helping us maintain the safety and trustworthiness of the platform. Follow this step-by-step disclosure process to report vulnerabilities in a way that ensures quick triage, remediation, and minimal risk to users.

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

We embrace responsible vulnerability disclosure as a cornerstone of our security strategy. This process is designed to:

- Encourage researchers and users to report potential security issues confidentially.
- Facilitate swift and structured triage and resolution by our security team.
- Minimize risks that could arise from public disclosure before a fix is in place.

This guide applies to all components within the Aave Vault project, including smart contracts, deployment scripts, and related infrastructure.

## 2. How to Report a Vulnerability

### Step 1: Verify the Vulnerability

Before reporting, please ensure:

- The issue is reproducible with clear and concrete steps.
- It impacts the security, integrity, or availability of the vault or its assets.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Report

Provide as much detail as possible to help us understand and reproduce the vulnerability:

- Description: A clear and concise summary of the problem.
- Impact: Explain the potential consequences or risks.
- Reproduction Steps: Detailed steps or proof-of-concept code demonstrating the issue.
- Environment: Include relevant details such as network, contract versions, or configurations.

### Step 3: Send Your Report

Submit your disclosure securely via our dedicated security contact channels:

- **Email:** `security@aave-vault.io`
- **PGP Key:** To encrypt sensitive information, you may use our published PGP key available on the official repository.

**Avoid public disclosure** of the vulnerability details until it has been addressed to prevent exploitation by malicious actors.

## 3. What to Expect After Reporting

Once we receive your report:

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 48 hours, we will confirm receipt and may request additional information if necessary.
- **Triage:** Our security team will assess the issue to determine severity and scope.
- **Remediation:** We commit to prompt investigation and fixing the issue, guided by the risk level.
- **Communication:** We will maintain communication with the reporter during the process.
- **Disclosure:** Once mitigated, we will coordinate a public disclosure timeline respecting the reporterâ€™s preferences and responsible disclosure guidelines.

---

## 4. Our Commitment to You

- **Respect and Recognition:** We recognize the value of contributors reporting security concerns and offer full credit upon public disclosure, unless anonymity is requested.
- **Swift Action:** We prioritize addressing security vulnerabilities to protect our users.
- **Transparency:** Updates about resolved vulnerabilities will be published in our security advisory channels.

## 5. Best Practices for Reporting

For an effective disclosure, please consider:

- Using secure channels to protect sensitive information.
- Being detailed but concise, avoiding overly technical jargon unless necessary.
- Including potential mitigation or workaround suggestions if applicable.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Do not share vulnerability details on public forums or social media before the issue is resolved.
- Avoid vague reports that lack steps to reproduce or evidence.
- Do not attempt to exploit a vulnerability beyond what is necessary for demonstration.
