# Meta-Transaction Authentication

Meta-transactions empower users to delegate transaction execution to third parties without directly paying gas fees or submitting transactions themselves. This page explains how the Aave Vault supports meta-transactions through EIP-712 compliant signatures, ensuring secure delegation, replay protection, and strong signature validation.

## 1. Introduction to Meta-Transactions

In decentralized finance, users often need to perform actions that require sending transactions—incurring gas costs and needing to be on-chain themselves. Meta-transactions allow users to sign a cryptographically-verifiable message offline and authorize another address (a relayer or operator) to submit the transaction on their behalf.

This design enables:

- **Gasless interactions:** Users without ETH or native token for gas can still interact.
- **Improved UX:** Actions can be batched or delegated to more efficient relayers.
- **Delegated permissioning:** Enables third parties to enact transactions under a user's explicit authorization.

## 2. How Aave Vault Implements Meta-Transaction Authentication

The Aave Vault leverages the EIP-712 standard for typed structured data signing, which improves security and interoperability by allowing users to sign typed messages rather than arbitrary data hashes. 

### Key Components:

- **EIP-712 Signatures:** Users sign structured permission messages offline.
- **Signature Validation:** Vault verifies signatures on-chain via `MetaTxHelpers` library.
- **Replay Protection:** Nonce tracking per address and signature expiration guard against replay attacks.

### Meta-Transaction Signature Workflow

1. **User Intent:** A user prepares the parameters for a vault operation (e.g., deposit, withdraw) including receiver, amount, nonce, and deadline.
2. **Generating Signature:** The user signs the typed data (structured via EIP-712) offline using their private key.
3. **Relayer Submission:** A relayer or another user submits the signed data on-chain by calling a `withSig` variant of the vault function (e.g., `depositWithSig`).
4. **On-Chain Verification:** The vault verifies the signature using the `MetaTxHelpers` library, ensuring validity, expiration, and matching parameters.
5. **Transaction Execution:** If verification passes, the vault executes the transaction on behalf of the signer.

## 3. Signature Validation Process

The core on-chain logic for confirming a meta-transaction signature involves multiple steps ensuring both the identity and integrity of the signer and the data:

### 3.1. Digest Calculation

- The vault calculates an EIP-712 digest combining the domain separator and the hashed structured message.
- This digest represents the unique fingerprint for the exact operation parameters.

### 3.2. Signature Recovery and Verification

- Using the `MetaTxHelpers._validateRecoveredAddress` method, the vault attempts to recover the signer address from the signature.
- Supports both EOAs and contract wallets implementing `IERC1271` for smart contract signature validation.
- Requires:
  - Signature deadline not expired.
  - Recovered address must match the expected signer.

### 3.3. Nonce and Replay Protection

- Each signer account has a nonce that the vault tracks.
- Nonces increment with each successful meta-transaction, preventing reuse of old signatures.

---

## 4. Supported Meta-Transaction Operations

The Aave Vault offers meta-transaction-enabled variants of key user NFT asset operations:

- `depositWithSig` / `depositATokensWithSig`
- `mintWithSig` / `mintWithATokensWithSig`
- `withdrawWithSig` / `withdrawATokensWithSig`
- `redeemWithSig` / `redeemWithATokensWithSig`

These functions accept an `EIP712Signature` struct that includes the signature and metadata necessary to authenticate the call.

## 5. User Flow Example: Performing a Deposit via Meta-Transaction

Imagine Alice wants to deposit tokens into the vault but does not want to submit the transaction herself:

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Alice Prepares the Deposit">
Alice creates the deposit parameters including amount, receiver address, and nonce.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Alice Signs the Deposit Authorization">
Using her wallet, Alice signs the structured deposit data following EIP-712 standard, producing a signature.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Relayer Calls depositWithSig">
Bob, acting as a relayer, submits the `depositWithSig` transaction including Alice’s signature.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: Vault Validates and Executes">
The vault recovers Alice’s address from the signature, verifies the nonce and deadline, then processes the deposit on Alice’s behalf.
</Step>
<Step title="Outcome">
Alice’s tokens are deposited without her paying gas, and Bob may receive a separate relayer fee.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Best Practices & Security Considerations

### For Users and Relayers:

- **Check Deadlines:** Always verify the signature's deadline to avoid expired calls.
- **Nonce Management:** Ensure nonce values are current and synchronized to avoid signature rejections.
- **Authorized Relayers:** Relayers should be trusted or operate transparently to avoid misuse.

### For Vault Managers:

- **Validate Signatures Strictly:** Enforce EIP-712 compliance and reject incorrect or malformed data.
- **Support Contract Wallets:** Accommodate IERC1271 compliant contracts for smart contract wallet users.
- **Monitor Nonce Usage:** Track and prevent replay attacks rigorously.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Using outdated signatures or incorrect nonces.
- Ignoring signature expiration leading to failed transactions.
- Accepting malformed or wrong function typehashes.

## 7. Troubleshooting Meta-Transaction Failures

If a meta-transaction fails, check:

- **Signature Validity:** Signature matches the operation parameters.
- **Domain Separator:** Consistency of the domain separator used for signing.
- **Nonce correctness:** Nonce supplied matches the next expected nonce for the signer.
- **Expiration:** The deadline has not passed.
- **Receiver and Owner mismatch:** Payload parameters match actual call parameters.

Failing any of these checks causes transactions to revert with errors such as `SIG_INVALID` or `SIG_EXPIRED`.

## 9. Code References

The following is a simplified illustration of the signature validation helper used in the smart contracts:

```solidity
library MetaTxHelpers {
    function _validateRecoveredAddress(
        bytes32 digest,
        address expectedAddress,
        IATokenVault.EIP712Signature calldata sig
    ) internal view {
        require(sig.deadline >= block.timestamp, "SIG_EXPIRED");

        address recoveredAddress = expectedAddress;

        if (recoveredAddress.code.length != 0) {
            // Contract wallet: verify using IERC1271
            bytes memory concatenatedSig = abi.encodePacked(sig.r, sig.s, sig.v);
            require(
                IERC1271(expectedAddress).isValidSignature(digest, concatenatedSig) ==
                EIP1271_MAGIC_VALUE,
                "SIG_INVALID"
            );
        } else {
            // Externally Owned Account (EOA): ecrecover
            recoveredAddress = ecrecover(digest, sig.v, sig.r, sig.s);
            require(recoveredAddress != address(0) && recoveredAddress == expectedAddress, "SIG_INVALID");
        }
    }

    function _calculateDigest(bytes32 hashedMessage, bytes32 domainSeparator) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked("\x19\x01", domainSeparator, hashedMessage));
    }
}
```

This logic ensures secure meta-transaction authorization that aligns with EIP-712.
